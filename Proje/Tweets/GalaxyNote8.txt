And this was the very first time I spent nearly $900 on a phone!?? @SamsungMobileUs #GalaxyNote8
Made up my mind and bought the #GalaxyNote8 in 'Midnight Black', of course! Best Decision Ever. @SamsungMobileUS https://t.co/GF5BO79ACZ
Now I? have to decide between a new #GalaxyNote8 or wait for #AppleiPhoneX because of a mistake @Apple @AppleSupport made..@tim_cook thanks
Couldn't afford the #GalaxyNote8 so here's to the #iPhone8Plus
I really want the Samsung #GalaxyNote8 but there are some features in the new #iPhone that I really want as well. Both are so expensive tho.
Just switched to the #GalaxyNote8 ! Loving it so far
I wish I was there too ?? @Samsung @SamsungMobile #GalaxyNote8 #ilovesamsung
@SamsungMobile @SamsungMobileUS @SamsungUS #GalaxyNote8 is awesome but stereo speaker/front facing would make it even better #2018 
with my new phone I have a #newlife in a Mobile world. #GalaxyNote8 #ByeBye #iPhone.
.@SamsungMobile @SamsungMobileUS @SamsungUS the #GalaxyNote8 auto-brightness is very poor on this device verse the Note 5. Any fix coming?
