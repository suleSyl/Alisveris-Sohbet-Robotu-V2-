@BekoUK MEEEEEE but I wish I could say it was my brand spanking NEW #BEKOWashingMachine ..well fingers crossed.
This machine isn't even a year old and has already required 3 service calls
Purchased the machine over 3 years ago. Found rust in the panels after 2 years and the machine was replaced.
Quieter than the previous machine.
Machine washes fantastically for the the price.
I can honestly say the after sales service was excellent.
Great washer
Fairly quiet and doesn't move too much when running.
The highest spin speed really helps get rid of any excess water and I could honestly go on and on about this amazing washing machine.
I'm amazed how quite and efficient it is but most of all I like the animal hair removal feature it has as I have a cat that maults over eveything..
