Electrolux 6kg Dryer EDV6051 - $899 (was $1099) #ChristmasGiftIdeas #ElectroluxDryer http://fb.me/3nRuCBqLl 
Worked fantastically well until the 2 year warranty ran out.
Overall a great product and well worth the money.
I love my new dryer it works so efficiently and is pleasantly quiet.
It's way to complicated for a dryer. A dryer shouldn't need so many adjustable settings.
Seems to be quite energy efficient and also delivers clothes that require no ironing.
The lint filter is easy to clean, being located at the front.
it is by far the best dryer I have ever owned! 
It stopped working after 3 years - but due to the low usage and difficulty in knowing when it stopped working
The Electrolux met all our requirements and more.
