@BoschAppliances is it possible to put a dryer on top of a washer with no risk of it falling down? any doc/manual explaining? #boschdryer
@BoschAppliances @icemilkaprons Thank you! Have one, love it! #BoschDryer
Ours worked well for a bit but broke down after a few months. 
I am so disappointed with this dryer.
Perfect dryer easy setup very easy to use.
It is quite different from other driers and that's what I love about it.
Took my chances and bought the new Bosch washer and a new dryer for the family beach house. 
Energy efficiency helps with bills.
Had to get used to not closing the door until a programme is selected with the dial.
instructions for finely adjusting the product could be improved.
