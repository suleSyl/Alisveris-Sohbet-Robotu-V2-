It's a #PhilipsTV 55POS9002 (OLED, 4K/HDR and Ambilight) looks great and doesn't have a lot of input lag!
@DennisM2208 Ive got a TV that was a few months old when it went out, and all I get back from #Philips is BS.  So never buy a #PhilipsTV!!
Dealing with #PhilipsTV customer service should be at the top of this list. 3 months & I still don't have a working TV. Its called WARRANTY
Don't buy a #PhilipsTV. They don't stand behind their faulty TV's, even when it's 6 months old and still in warranty. @PhilipsPR
Enough is enough. Will reach consumer court now. #boycottPhilips #PhilipsTV #PhilipsIndia #Philips worst experience ever.
@NOWTV #nowtv @Philips #philipstv #philips #tvissue #nowtvissue Can anybody help me with this issue please? No help found online.
After the updates the tv is fucked up??#philipstv
Never buy a #PhilipsTv! Our remote died in under a yr. Contacted them for a new 1 & they refuse w/o 2 proof of purchases!! WTF?!
@Philips this is what a working TV looks like..... Its probably a rare site around #PhilipsTV ?? 
I can't sleep with out a TV, and mine 5 month old #PhilipsTV brok 3 months ago.  @Philips doesn't care though. It's cheaper not to.
