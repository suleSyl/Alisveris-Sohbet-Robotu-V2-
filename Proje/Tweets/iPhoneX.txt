the #iPhoneX gave me whiplash
If you have a twin sibling and buy an iPhone X, you’re fucked. Say goodbye to privacy. #facerecognition #iPhoneX
Love the camera on my new phone #portraitmode #iphonex #mymax 
Little scuff on my #iPhoneX screen. Better than a crack I guess
Using my #iPhoneX heavily during the whole day since 7am this morning. Still about 35% battery left! ?? (For an iPhone, this is good??) @Apple
Unable to understand why people are lined up to pay over $1K for #iPhoneX store is full.
I can pick up the #iPhoneX now but I have to cancel your existing preorder. Cancels exciting order. Sorry that item isn't available anymore.
iPhone X #iphonex Hanging around for 3 days in a queue just to purchase a hype phone means that something went wrong with your life.
1st call for an #iPhoneX #iPhone10 screen repair....sorry but that's not a possible repair at the moment.
Really digging this iPhoneX, but my fat hands got used to the size of the 6-8 Plus models. Now I need to slim down my meaty paws. ??????
